# GigBud

## Description
GigBud is a mobile application that allows users to sign into their preferred streaming service and begin saving playlists from their favorite artist's recent setlists. GigBud uses setlist.fm to search for recent playlists from an artist and then uses the api of the preferred streaming service to save the songs into a single playlist on the user's account.

## Flow
On initial use, a user will choose a streaming service to login to. On all other app loads, this preference will be saved. A user will search for an artist. The recent setlists from setlist.fm will be displayed to the user. The user will choose one of the setlists and a form for creating a playlist from the tracks will be displayed. After filling out the fields, the user will press the button to create the playlist and the playlist will be added to their account on the streaming service.
